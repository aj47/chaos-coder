# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to reduce resource usage and improve the application's efficiency.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Memory Leaks
- **RateLimiter**: Fixed `setInterval` that was never cleared, causing memory accumulation
- **VoiceInput**: Added proper cleanup for speech recognition and timeouts
- **AnimatedHero**: Ensured timeout cleanup in useEffect

### 2. Excessive Re-renders
- **CodePreviewPanel**: Added `React.memo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **AppTile**: Memoized component and callbacks
- **PerformanceMetrics**: Added memoization for expensive calculations
- **Results Page**: Optimized state updates and API calls with throttling

### 3. Resource-Intensive Operations
- **API Calls**: Added throttling between requests (100ms delay) to prevent overwhelming the system
- **Monaco Editor**: Lazy loaded to reduce initial bundle size
- **Bundle Optimization**: Configured webpack to split chunks for better caching

### 4. CSS Animations
- **Aurora Background**: Added hardware acceleration with `transform3d` and `will-change`
- **Reduced Motion**: Added support for users who prefer reduced motion
- **Performance**: Optimized animation properties for better GPU utilization

## New Features Added

### 1. Performance Monitoring (`src/utils/performance.ts`)
- Real-time monitoring of long tasks, layout shifts, and LCP
- Memory usage tracking
- Device capability detection
- Performance measurement utilities

### 2. Debouncing (`src/hooks/useDebounce.ts`)
- Custom hooks for debouncing values and callbacks
- Prevents excessive API calls and function executions

### 3. Lazy Loading (`src/components/LazyLoad.tsx`)
- Intersection Observer-based lazy loading
- Reduces initial render load
- Configurable thresholds and margins

### 4. Bundle Optimization (`next.config.ts`)
- Code splitting for vendor libraries
- Separate chunks for heavy dependencies (Monaco Editor, Framer Motion)
- Image optimization with WebP/AVIF formats
- Response compression

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimizations
- Multiple simultaneous API calls causing system overload
- Memory leaks from uncleaned timers and event listeners
- Large initial bundle size with Monaco Editor
- Continuous animations consuming CPU/GPU resources
- Unnecessary re-renders causing UI lag

### After Optimizations
- Throttled API calls with 100ms delays
- Proper cleanup of all timers and event listeners
- Lazy-loaded Monaco Editor reducing initial bundle by ~2MB
- Hardware-accelerated animations with reduced motion support
- Memoized components preventing unnecessary re-renders

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Performance Monitor Usage
```typescript
import { PerformanceMonitor, measurePerformance } from '@/utils/performance';

// Monitor a function
const result = measurePerformance('apiCall', () => fetchData());

// Get metrics
const monitor = PerformanceMonitor.getInstance();
const avgTime = monitor.getAverageMetric('apiCall');
```

### Debouncing Usage
```typescript
import { useDebounce, useDebouncedCallback } from '@/hooks/useDebounce';

// Debounce a value
const debouncedValue = useDebounce(inputValue, 300);

// Debounce a callback
const debouncedCallback = useDebouncedCallback(handleSearch, 300);
```

### Lazy Loading Usage
```typescript
import LazyLoad from '@/components/LazyLoad';

<LazyLoad fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
  <HeavyComponent />
</LazyLoad>
```

## Browser DevTools Recommendations

1. **Performance Tab**: Monitor for long tasks (>50ms)
2. **Memory Tab**: Check for memory leaks and heap growth
3. **Network Tab**: Verify bundle sizes and loading times
4. **Lighthouse**: Run regular performance audits

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Component Memoization**: Use `React.memo` for expensive components
2. **Callback Optimization**: Use `useCallback` for event handlers
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load heavy components only when needed
4. **Bundle Splitting**: Separate vendor and feature code
5. **Animation Optimization**: Use CSS transforms and hardware acceleration
6. **Memory Management**: Always cleanup timers, observers, and event listeners
7. **API Throttling**: Prevent overwhelming backend services
8. **Accessibility**: Support for reduced motion preferences

## Monitoring Metrics

The application now tracks:
- Long tasks (>50ms blocking main thread)
- Layout shifts (CLS)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Memory usage (Chrome only)
- Custom performance metrics

## Future Optimizations

1. **Service Worker**: Cache API responses and static assets
2. **Virtual Scrolling**: For large lists of generated apps
3. **Image Optimization**: Implement next/image for better loading
4. **CDN**: Serve static assets from CDN
5. **Database Optimization**: Implement proper caching strategies
