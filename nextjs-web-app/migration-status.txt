STATUS: Migration Partially Applied

CHANGES COMPLETED:
1. Updated TypeScript types in src/types/supabase.ts to remove first_name field references
2. Verified that src/lib/auth/index.ts and src/app/auth/callback/route.ts already had first_name references removed (only comments remain)

PENDING CHANGES:
1. Database Migration: The SQL migration file (db/remove_first_name.sql) needs to be applied to the Supabase database
   - We encountered DNS resolution issues when trying to connect directly to db.xskelhjnymrbogeloxfy.supabase.co
   - Alternative approaches to apply the migration:
     a. Apply through Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
     b. Use Supabase CLI with proper authentication
     c. Contact Supabase support if issues persist

VERIFICATION STEPS AFTER MIGRATION:
1. Verify the first_name column has been removed from the profiles table
2. Verify that all code functions properly without the first_name field
3. Check that new user registration works as expected

ROLLBACK PLAN (IF NEEDED):
1. Add the first_name column back to the profiles table
2. Restore the first_name field in the TypeScript types
3. Update any code that was modified to handle the field
